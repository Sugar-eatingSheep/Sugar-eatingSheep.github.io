Yang Chen is currently pursuing an M.Sc. degree in Civil Engineering at the University of Hong Kong. Before that, he received his dual bachelor degrees from Chang'an University (211 Project), Xi'an, China, and University College Dublin (2025 QS World University Ranking: 126), Ireland. At these two institutions, he earned a B.Eng. degree in Transportation and a B.Sc. degree (**First Class Honours**) in Transport, City Planning & Environmental Policy, respectively.

During his undergraduate studies, Yang Chen had accumulated extensive research experience. After the pandemic (nearly 2 years of pitiful dormitory life 😥), starting from the summer between his sophomore and junior years, he led a Provincial College Student Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training Program as the project leader and participated as the second leader in a National College Student Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training Program. Both projects explored safety issues encountered by human drivers from the perspectives of human factors and traffic safety, focusing on issues such as pedal misapplication and visual blind spots.

Since then, Yang Chen developed research interests in **traffic safety, human factors, and intelligent transportation**. Throughout the subsequent two years of his undergraduate studies, he came up with many ideas and conducted much research at the School of Automobile, Chang'an University, and the Key Laboratory of Automobile Transportation Safety Technology, Ministry of Transport, China. He served as a **part-time research assistant**, leading projects such as **topics in L2-level human-machine co-driving modes** (e.g., fatigue, distraction, driving habits, etc.), **interactions between vulnerable traffic participants** (e.g., pedestrians, non-motorized vehicles, etc.) and autonomous vehicles in VR environments, and **evaluation of motion sickness characteristics in electric vehicle passengers** (with the latter two projects still ongoing 😀).

1. Wu F W (Supervisor), Sun W C, **Chen Y**, et al. (2024) A Comparative Study on Pedestrian Perception of Vehicle Movement Information in Virtual Reality and Real-world Environments 虚实环境下行人对车辆运动信息感知特性对比研究. Submitted to Journal of Transportation Systems Engineering and Information Technology 交通运输系统工程与信息 (EI, IF=2.27). Under review.
<br /> This paper conducted the experimental tasks of vehicle speed estimation and vehicle arrival time estimation in both environments, and a total of 37 subjects' experimental data were collected. By comparing and analyzing the performance of participants' perception of vehicle motion information with the bias values of estimated speed and arrival time as the analytical indexes, this paper discusses the influence of the vehicle speed, individual characteristics and other factors on the experimental results. The results demonstrate that compared to the real-world experiment, pedestrians tend to underestimate vehicle speed in VR environments, although their estimation of arrival time remains consistent; vehicle speed has a consistent trend in affecting pedestrians' perceptual bias in both environments; and different individual characteristics do not contribute to the differences in pedestrians' perceptions between the two environments. These research findings can provide theoretical references for studying interactions between pedestrians and vehicles in VR environments.
